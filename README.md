# 🚦 PRODIGY_DS_05: Traffic Accident Analysis

This repository contains my submission for **Task 05** of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship.

## 📄 Project Overview
**Objective:** Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day.
**Dataset:** [US Accidents (3 Million Records)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) (or whichever dataset you used).

I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors. As an engineer interested in **Smart Cities** and **DePIN**, I see this analysis as critical for training autonomous vehicle networks and validating on-chain insurance claims.

## 📊 Key Findings
* **Time of Day:** Accidents peak during morning and evening rush hours (7-9 AM and 4-6 PM), confirming the correlation with commuter density.
* **Weather Impact:** A significant number of accidents occur during "Clear" weather, suggesting that driver behavior (distraction/speeding) is a bigger factor than environmental conditions.
* **Road Conditions:** Intersections and traffic signals are high-risk zones, indicating a need for better signal timing or automated traffic management.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Seaborn & Matplotlib** (Heatmaps, Time-series analysis)
* **Folium** (For geospatial mapping, if you used it)
